# STAC Extensions

The [stac-extensions](https://github.com/stac-extensions/) GitHub organization is a home for extensions to the
[SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) specification.

To learn about STAC and Extensions start with the [extensions](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/extensions)
section of the core specification. It explains how extensions work, lists all the known extensions, and has
instructions for how to go about '[extending STAC](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/extensions/README.md#extending-stac)'.

The [stac-extensions](https://github.com/stac-extensions/) GitHub organization is a home for many of the leading 'community extensions',
providing a neutral home for collaboration. Many of these used to be in the core
[stac-spec repository](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec), but were removed for 1.0.0 so they could evolve at their
own pace, instead of having to follow the core STAC release cycle.

## List of STAC Extensions

This is meant to be the definitive list of STAC Extensions, but not all of them may be part of this GitHub organization.

An asterisk (*) indicates a community extension that is hosted externally.
As such is not part of the stac-extensions GitHub organization and may not follow the normal procedure or classification for STAC extensions, e.g. regarding the maturity.

Below you can also find a list of extensions grouped by [maturity](#grouped-by-maturity).

## Adding a new extension

The general idea on how to [extend STAC](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/extensions/README.md#extending-stac)
and [propose new extensions](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/extensions/README.md#proposing-new-extensions) is explained on [the page about extensions in the stac-spec repository](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/extensions/README.md).

### Using the stac-extensions template

**Create the repository:**

* Go to [template repository](https://github.com/stac-extensions/template), hit the green 'Use this template' button and choose 'Create a new repository'.
* Be sure to pick the right place ('Owner' and 'Repository name') to create it. You can request (via Gitter or e-mail) to become a member of the stac-extensions organization or put the next repository under your personal account or any other organization.
* Add a concise and clear description of the extension, it will be used as a description in the list above!
* Click 'Include all branches' for the CI to write correctly.
* Finish this by clicking the 'Create repository from template' button

**Write your extension:**

* In the repository 'Settings' go to 'Pages' and set the 'Source' to 'Deploy from a branch' and for the 'Branch' select 'gh-pages' and '/ (root)'
* Update the title, identifier, field name prefix, scope, and owner. Don't mess around with the formatting or structure as this will be used to generate the table above!
* Update the fields, select where they can be used, add documentation, etc. in the README.md
* Update the JSON Schema accordingly in schemas/schema.json
* Add examples
* Go through the files and update everything that is still named 'template' (the easiest way is to let an IDE/Editor search through all the files for 'template')
* Run the tests
* Update the changelog
* Let people discuss your extension, e.g. via Gitter
* Eventually, release the extension via GitHub Releases

You can add external/community extensions to the list above by editing the [config file](https://github.com/stac-extensions/stac-extensions.github.io/edit/main/python/config.py)
and creating a Pull Request for the change. All extensions hosted in the stac-extensions organization will be added automatically each night.
